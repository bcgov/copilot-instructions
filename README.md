# Shared Copilot Instructions

Shared VS Code configuration to accelerate and guide the use of GitHub Copilot, an AI coding assistant.

## Installation

### All Workspaces (Recommended)

This configuration applies the upstream Copilot instructions globally across all VS Code workspaces.

1. **Download or update the upstream instructions centrally**

   Copy `.github/copilot-upstream.md` to your home directory manually or using the commands below (Linux, macOS).

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config
   curl -Lo ~/.config/copilot-upstream.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcgov/copilot-instructions/main/.github/copilot-upstream.md
   ```

2. **Configure VS Code to use the instructions**

   Create or update `settings.json`, using an **absolute path** to your file.

   - **Manual method (Linux, macOS)**

     Suggested location: `~/.config/Code/User/settings.json`

     ```jsonc
     {
       "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles": true,
       "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
         {
           "file": "/home/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/.config/copilot-upstream.md"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

   - **Manual method (Windows)**

     Suggested location: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json`

     ```jsonc
     {
       "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles": true,
       "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
         {
           "file": "C:\\Users\\<YOUR_USER_NAME>\\.config\\copilot-upstream.md"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

   - **Programmatic method (Linux)**

     ```bash
     SETTINGS="$HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json"
     mkdir -p "$(dirname "$SETTINGS")"
     [ -s "$SETTINGS" ] || echo '{}' > "$SETTINGS"

     jq --arg file "$HOME/.config/copilot-upstream.md" '
       . + {
         "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles": true,
         "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [ { "file": $file } ]
       }
     ' "$SETTINGS" > "$SETTINGS.tmp" && mv "$SETTINGS.tmp" "$SETTINGS"
     ```

   - **Programmatic method (macOS)**

     ```bash
     SETTINGS="$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json"
     mkdir -p "$(dirname "$SETTINGS")"
     [ -s "$SETTINGS" ] || echo '{}' > "$SETTINGS"

     jq --arg file "$HOME/.config/copilot-upstream.md" '
       . + {
         "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles": true,
         "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [ { "file": $file } ]
       }
     ' "$SETTINGS" > "$SETTINGS.tmp" && mv "$SETTINGS.tmp" "$SETTINGS"
     ```

   **Note: Programmatic methods only work for properly formatted JSON in `settings.json`. VS Code allows inconsistencies, while `jq` does not.**

### Single Repository

This will affect only the current repository. It is useful when projects have conflicting or incompatible requirements.

1. **Download the upstream instructions to your repository**

   Copy `.github/copilot-upstream.md` manually or use the commands below (Linux, macOS). Make sure to commit this file to your repository.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github
   curl -Lo .github/copilot-upstream.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcgov/copilot-instructions/main/.github/copilot-upstream.md
   ```

2. **Configure VS Code to use the instructions**

   Configure VS Code Workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`) manually **or** programmatically:

   - **Manual method (Linux, macOS)**

     ```jsonc
     {
       "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles": true,
       "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
         {
           "file": ".github/copilot-upstream.md"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

   - **Manual method (Windows)**

     ```jsonc
     {
       "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles": true,
       "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
         {
           "file": ".github\\copilot-upstream.md"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

   - **Programmatic method (Linux, macOS)**

     Use `jq` to add or update the Copilot instruction settings:

     ```bash
     mkdir -p .vscode
     [ -s .vscode/settings.json ] || echo '{}' > .vscode/settings.json

     jq '.
       + {"github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles": true}
       + {"github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [{"file": ".github/copilot-upstream.md"}]}
     ' .vscode/settings.json > .vscode/settings.tmp && mv .vscode/settings.tmp .vscode/settings.json
     ```

### Notes

**Absolute Paths:**

Only absolute paths work in global `settings.json`.

**Synchronization:**

If VS Code is synchronizing settings across devices, make sure this file is present on those devices.

**Safety/Reliability:**

If the path is not valid, there will be no effect. It is harmless.

**Updates:**

Replace your copy of this file periodically to receive updated configurations.

**Customization:**

Put your changes in a separate file. The default repo location is `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

**Usage:**

For most projects, the default setup works well out of the box.

## Examples

### Creating Pull Requests with Copilot and GitHub CLI

To quickly create a pull request from the terminal, ask Copilot:

> "Give me a PR command using gh cli."



Copilot will generate a single command block that follows the shared instructions in `.github/copilot-upstream.md`, including a conventional commit title and a markdown-formatted PR body.

Just copy and paste the command block into your terminal—no manual editing required.

## Optimization Tips

If you experience inconsistent AI behavior, consider these common issues:

### Instruction Overload Symptoms
- Steps not followed reliably
- Critical safety rules ignored (e.g., accidental pushes to main)
- Previously working commands suddenly failing
- AI decision paralysis with conflicting rules

### Solutions
- **Safety rules first**: Put critical rules (like git workflow protections) at the top of your instructions
- **Hierarchical organization**: Use global rules + project-specific additions rather than duplicating everything
- **Keep it focused**: Aim for under 300 total lines of instructions per session
- **Move complexity to docs**: Put detailed workflows in documentation, keep instructions concise

The shared instructions in this repository follow these principles with safety-critical rules prioritized first.

## AI Safety and Git Protection

**CRITICAL**: AI tools can accidentally push to main branches, causing production issues. This function prevents dangerous git operations while educating users about modern git practices.

### Installation

**System-wide installation** (protects all users including AI tools):

Create the file `/etc/profile.d/git-safety.sh` and make it executable with `chmod +x`.  Contents:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Git Safety Function - Prevents dangerous operations by AI and all users
# This file is automatically sourced by all bash sessions on the system

git() {
    local args="$*"
    local current_branch=$(command git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null)

    # Auto-detect default branch
    local default_branch=$(command git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@' 2>/dev/null || echo main)

    if [[ "$current_branch" = "$default_branch" ]]; then
        local first_cmd=$(echo "$args" | awk '{print $1}')
        local allowed_commands="branch checkout config diff fetch help log pull restore show status switch version"

        if [[ " $allowed_commands " != *" $first_cmd "* ]]; then
            echo "🚨 BLOCKED: '$first_cmd' not allowed on default branch ($default_branch)! Use feature branches."
            return 1
        fi
    fi

    $(command which git) "$@"
}

export -f git
```

### How It Works

- **Only restricts operations on default branch** - other branches work normally
- **Uses allowlist approach** - only explicitly allowed commands work on the default branch
- **Blocks dangerous operations** like `commit`, `push`, `merge`

### Example Usage

```bash
# On main branch - these work but show warnings
git checkout -b feature    # → ⚠️ DEPRECATED: Use 'git switch' instead!

# On main branch - these are blocked
git commit -m "fix"        # → 🚨 BLOCKED: 'commit' not allowed on main branch!

# Admin override (when needed)
command git push origin main  # → Bypasses all restrictions
```

This solution provides comprehensive protection against AI tools pushing to main while educating users about modern git practices.
