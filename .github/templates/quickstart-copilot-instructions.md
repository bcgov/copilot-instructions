# Quickstart Template Repository - AI Coding Instructions

This repository follows BCGov AI coding standards with Quickstart template specific enhancements.

## Repository Context
This is a template repository (quickstart-*) designed to help BCGov teams bootstrap new projects quickly. Code quality and documentation completeness are critical since other teams will copy this as their starting point.

## Quickstart Template Practices

### Template Completeness
- Ensure all example files are functional and up-to-date
- Include comprehensive configuration examples for all supported scenarios
- Provide working examples that teams can run immediately after cloning
- Include both minimal and advanced configuration options
- Test template regularly to ensure it works with latest dependencies

### Documentation Excellence
- README must be comprehensive and beginner-friendly
- Include step-by-step setup instructions that assume no prior knowledge
- Provide clear explanations of what each file/directory does
- Include troubleshooting section for common setup issues
- Document all configuration options with examples and defaults

### Example Code Standards
- All example code should follow current BCGov coding standards
- Include comprehensive error handling in examples
- Demonstrate security best practices in sample code
- Show proper logging and monitoring setup
- Include examples of testing strategies appropriate for the template type

### Configuration Management
- Provide secure configuration examples (no hardcoded secrets)
- Include environment-specific configuration patterns
- Demonstrate proper secrets management approaches
- Show how to configure for different deployment environments
- Include configuration validation examples

### CI/CD Pipeline Examples
- Include working GitHub Actions workflows appropriate for the project type
- Provide examples for testing, security scanning, and deployment
- Include both basic and advanced pipeline configurations
- Demonstrate proper secret management in CI/CD
- Show integration with BCGov standard tools and processes

### Dependency Management
- Keep dependencies current and security-patched
- Include dependency update automation where appropriate
- Document dependency choices and alternatives
- Provide guidance on when to update vs. pin versions
- Include security scanning for vulnerabilities

### Template Maintenance
- Regularly update template to incorporate new BCGov standards
- Test template with new dependency versions
- Gather feedback from teams using the template and incorporate improvements
- Maintain changelog of template improvements and breaking changes
- Coordinate with other quickstart templates to ensure consistency

### Team Onboarding Support
- Include learning resources and links to relevant documentation
- Provide examples that demonstrate incrementally complex features
- Include guidance on how to customize the template for specific needs
- Show how to remove template-specific files after customization
- Include "next steps" guidance for teams after initial setup

### Multi-Platform Considerations
- Support development on different operating systems where possible
- Include Docker configurations for consistent development environments
- Provide cloud deployment examples (OpenShift, AWS, Azure as relevant)
- Consider different team sizes and experience levels
- Include accessibility and internationalization examples where relevant

### Quality Assurance
- Include comprehensive testing examples appropriate for the project type
- Demonstrate proper error handling and validation patterns
- Show monitoring and observability setup examples
- Include performance testing examples where relevant
- Provide security testing and validation examples

## Template Customization Notes
When teams use this template:
1. Replace all placeholder values (PROJECT_NAME, etc.)
2. Update README with project-specific information
3. Customize configuration for specific requirements
4. Remove template-specific documentation files
5. Initialize proper git history (not template history)

## Template Feedback
Encourage teams to provide feedback on template effectiveness and suggest improvements. Template success is measured by how quickly teams can get productive after using it.

Remember: This template will be someone's first impression of BCGov development standards - make it count!
