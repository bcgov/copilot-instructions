## Usage

1. **Copy the appropriate template** to your repository as `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
2. **Customize** the content for your specific project needs
3. **Remove template-specific** notes and instructions
4. **Test** that AI assistants pick up your repository-specific guidance

## Template Philosophy

These templates **extend** the base BCGov standards in `copilot-upstream.md` rather than replacing them. They provide domain-specific guidance that helps AI assistants understand the unique requirements of different repository types.

Each template is based on analysis of 80+ BCGov repositories and real-world patterns observed across the organization.
